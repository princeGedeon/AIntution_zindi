1,Can the Conference of the Parties of the WHO FCTC assist countries in securing financial resources for implementation?,1,1_WHO_FCTC,"Consent Building Block deals with transparency on data usage in a given context. Thus privacy-by-design of the system's actors is often an excellent guiding principle for interpreting international, national, and organisational policies and governance principles to implement the functional consent framework. A tangible outcome from a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) is a structured approach that can deliver the input for the actual implementation of the Consent Building Block.","The scope for the current version of Consent Building Block assumes that the Individual is acting for themselves. Ultimately the Consent Building Block will include in the Consenting Process the capacity to sign a Consent Agreement in the name of another individual - to act as the Delegate, which is used as the criterion for technical implementation. However, the Delegate and the Individual relationship is expected to be maintained outside of the Consent Manager, which assumes that the person signing the Consent Agreement (i.e. Consenter) has been authorised to do so.

The table below summarises the key use cases identified for the Individuals.

Consent use-cases

Certificate authorities MUST support the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) so that an Information Mediator can check certificate validity.

Time-stamping authorities securely facilitate time stamping of messages. Time stamping authorities MUST support batched time stamping.

The Service Registry provides a mechanism for building blocks to register the services that they provide and for other building blocks to discover and consume those services. Any services provided or consumed by a Building Block that leverages the Information Mediator architecture MUST use this service registry functionality.

2.5 Keywords and Definitions","This document is intended to provide guidance for building block working groups and developers of products that will be integrated into a GovStack implementation. It also provides guidlines for implementers and system integrators who are deploying solutions that leverage the GovStack approach. It provides guidelines and principles that should be considered by all building blocks and cross-cutting requirements that must be considered for any GovStack project.

This will accelerate the collaborative development of best-of-breed digital public goods, enhancing efficiency and transparency across the world - especially in low-resource settings.

2.1 GovStack and the Building Blocks Approach","Paraphrased from the Amazon API Mandate: https://api-university.com/blog/the-api-mandate/

All BBs must expose their data and functionality through service interfaces (APIs).

Building Blocks communicate with each other through these interfaces.

There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.

It doesn’t matter what technology is used. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols — doesn’t matter.

All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.

Building blocks MUST NOT use shared databases, file systems or memory for data exchange with other building blocks.

5.4 APIs must be Versioned (REQUIRED)"
2,"What should be the minimum size of health warnings and messages on tobacco products, and where should they be placed?",1,1_WHO_FCTC,"A building block MAY provide a mock testing implementation of API functionality to show example endpoints and data payloads. See https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/bb-template/tree/main/examples for additional information.

5.27 Building blocks should be Localizable (RECOMMENDED)

Where a building block has a human user interaction, it SHOULD be able to present information to the user in their local language. Building blocks should be designed to support multiple locales.

5.28 Use NTP Synchronization (RECOMMENDED)

Where precise timestamps are required, building blocks SHOULD leverage Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize timestamps between servers.

Other Considerations

Software development best practices are recommended for all building blocks. The following guidelines should be followed as part of the software development process.

EOL SHOULD be at Least 5 Years","Auditing of inappropriate data access is only possible when a log trace exists.

5 Cross-Cutting Requirements

This section will highlight important requirements or describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this Building Block.

5.1 Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the architecture specification document. Any implementation MUST adhere to all requirements from GovStack Security Requirements.

5.1.1 Personal data MUST be kept private (REQUIRED)","Personal data MUST be kept private and never shared with any parties, except where specific authorisation has been granted. The Consent Building Block shall follow the privacy principles as laid out in the GovStack architecture.

5.1.2 Data Policy Audit Logging (REQUIRED)

Logs MUST be kept in a database of all created, updated, or deleted records. Logs MUST include timestamps and identify the user and affiliation that performed the transaction.

5.1.3 Follow GovStack Access control requirements (RECOMMENDED)","JSON SHOULD be used for data models/services wherever possible. See https://www.json.org/json-en.html. Where JSON exhange is not possible, building blocks must use other standard data formats (such as XML).

5.24 Use Existing Standards for Data Interchange, Where Available (RECOMMENDED)

If an existing standard is available, it should be used, e.g. DICOM/Hl7/FHIR for healthcare. TMForum has a large library of standardized APIs and data models that can be used.

Building blocks and building block solutions MUST leverage existing standards, especially those listed in the Standards section below.

5.25 Use I/O Sanitization (RECOMMENDED)

Building blocks SHOULD validate all incoming data to ensure that it conforms with the expected format and type. APIs should also sanitize incoming data, removing any unsafe characters or tokens.

5.26 Provide a Compliance Test Mock/Example Implementation (OPTIONAL)","The use of consent should be avoided in cases as below, which are not part of this specification:

When a person is simply informed of the processing of the data by the organisation as part of the service provided under contract or by an authority.

When consent does not have to be obtained in a situation where the entity does not identify or cannot identify people with reasonable effort.



Assumptions

Lays out the pre-conditions needed for anyone to use the Consent Building Block.

Data Disclosure Agreements between organisations are already in place. For example, a healthcare organisation has already got the required authorisation to use the citizen data registry.

To link a Consent Agreement with the specific Individual, Consent Building Block assumes the authentication and authorization to be handled in a trusted manner outside of it (see below)."

5.1 Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the architecture specification document. Any implementation MUST adhere to all requirements from GovStack Security Requirements.

5.1.1 Personal data MUST be kept private (REQUIRED)","Building Blocks MUST conform to GDPR principles, including the right to be forgotten account deletion, and privacy requirements to protect the rights of individuals. Note that these requirements may vary by region, and building blocks must conform to regulatory requirements wherever they are deployed.

5.10 Include Support for Capturing Logging information (REQUIRED)

Building Blocks MUST have a mechanism for generating logging information. This may be as simple as using STDOUT and capturing through docker logs, or may use other log sinking technologies.

5.11 Use Web Hooks for Callbacks (REQUIRED)

When Building Blocks require callback functionality, they must use webhooks and not direct links to functions within the building block.

5.12 Enforce Transport Security (REQUIRED)

All Building Blocks MUST support secure HTTPS transport with TLS 1.3 and insecure cyphers disabled.

5.13 GET and PUT APIs must be Idempotent (REQUIRED)","The Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent Records) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that is legally required to collect the consent. Since it can be either a Data Consuming organisation or a Data Providing organisation, the Consent Building Block allows both to be able to verify their conformance with the underlying Data Policy, both organisations must be able to access and use the application.

While the Actors generally fall in line with the categories of the functionalities, it is important to realise that “auditing” functions in the narrow sense, verifying if data processing is being (or has been) processed according to the Data Policy requiring a consent, is relevant to various entities involved in the data processing. For this reason, the generic “verification” activity may be executed as part of various workflows satisfying the needs of different actors."

5.1 Requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the architecture specification document. Any implementation MUST adhere to all requirements from GovStack Security Requirements.

5.1.1 Personal data MUST be kept private (REQUIRED)","In the GovStack context, consent is understood as a voluntary declaration by an individual to approve the processing of their Personal Data. It is one specific justification for Personal Data processing that is assumed to be required by legal or ethical conditions. It assumes that the person can decide on processing their Personal Data, managed in and by other GovStack Building Blocks, and also that the person is free to withdraw their consent at any time.

Some examples of such consent are:

allowing a healthcare provider to fetch socio-demographic data from a government-run population registry to provide adequate primary healthcare services.

allowing a government official to fetch relevant data from other/multiple government-run registries to analyse the eligibility for a social benefit programme.

allow a government official to send Personal Data to a bank for cash transfers on behalf of the government.

What Consent Is Not","Building Blocks MUST conform to GDPR principles, including the right to be forgotten account deletion, and privacy requirements to protect the rights of individuals. Note that these requirements may vary by region, and building blocks must conform to regulatory requirements wherever they are deployed.

Each building block specification SHOULD specify mitigations for these issues.

4 Building Block Design Principles

While the following principles are relevant to many technology deployments, when leveraging the GovStack approach it is important to keep these principles in mind during all phases of design, development, and deployment.

4.1 Citizen-Centric","From Wikipedia: a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

4.4 Secure

With any technology deployment, security is paramount. Detailed security requirements are defined in the GovStack Security Requirements. Beyond those standards, Building Blocks should have the following attributes:

Building Blocks are audited and certified before being made available

Development processes and standards enforce quality and security

Different certification levels reflect level of standards-compliance

Regular security scanning and auditing

Public ratings and reviews

Comprehensive logging and exception handling

4.5 Accessible

It is vitally important that technology solutions be usable by all. Some characteristics of accessible design include:","The SDG Digital Investment Framework, developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL), has formally defined criteria. Building blocks MUST meet the following criteria:

Reusable software components

Licensed as open source, proprietary, or freely available with Open Access to data

Facilitates one or more generic Workflows

Applicable to multiple SDG Use Cases across multiple sectors

Interoperable with other ICT Building Blocks

Designed for Scalability

Designed for Extensibility

Standards Based Conformance or Compliance

Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)

Additionally, the Digital Public Goods Alliance has created a definition of Building Blocks. In this definition, a building block:

Refers to software code, platforms, and applications that are interoperable, provide a basic digital service at scale, and can be reused for multiple use cases and contexts.

Serves as a component of a larger system or stack.","GovStack aims to provide a reference architecture for digital governance software to support sustainable development goals. Rooted in a ""Whole-of-Government"" approach, the GovStack Framework provides a methodology for leveraging common technology components and infrastructure to more easily create and deploy interoperable digital platforms which can address high-priority use cases across multiple sectors. The guidelines and requirements described in this document provide a framework for the development of digital building blocks oriented toward this goal.

4 Building Block Design Principles

While the following principles are relevant to many technology deployments, when leveraging the GovStack approach it is important to keep these principles in mind during all phases of design, development, and deployment.

4.1 Citizen-Centric","Design of systems should be rooted in the needs of the citizens/users of these platforms. A Citizen-centric technology will include the following attributes:

User-centered design

Right to be forgotten: everything must be deletable

The best tools evolve from empathizing, understanding and designing for the needs of end-users. Accordingly, we’ve identified a series of use cases and user journeys here: GovStack Use Cases

Each use case is composed of a collection of modules, or building blocks. As you can see, a relatively small set of these building blocks can be readily applied to a wide variety of applications in low-resource settings.

4.2 Open

Where possible, GovStack advocates for the use of open technology, which can reduce cost and help avoid vendor lock-in. Open technology can be defined as:

Based on open standards

Based on Digital Development Principles, see https://digitalprinciples.org/ and https://digitalinvestmentprinciples.org/","Individual consent is captured within the context of digital interaction. This interaction is composite of all the information systems involved, not solely the Consent Building Block. Thus, the legal and ethical boundaries of consent are defined in the entirety of the interaction. In particular, consent, as defined by ISO/TS 17975:2015(E), should be seen as a ""set of agreements and constraints"" that an informed and knowledgeable [individual] agrees to apply to their data processing. This definition, not based on the purpose of the data usage, can lead to a consent management framework also incorporating authorisations or unrelated constraints of the system. For example, in health information and healthcare service delivery, consent is also the process whereby a set of constraints is agreed upon so that information may be collected and used or disclosed. However, it is also the outcome of the process. As a rule of thumb, limiting unintended secondary usage of data is helpful to","Definition: In this phase, the organisation (a Data Provider or a Data Consumer) adopts and defines a Data Policy that applies to the industry or sector-specific data usage as a template. While this phase is considered a “black box” to the Consent Building Block, it is an essential reference point for configuration and compatibility checks in all following phases.

Preparation: In this phase, the organisation (Data Provider or Data Consumer) that intends to process Personal Data configures the Consent Agreement and relevant rules for its use. An organisation could use Personal Data for third-party data sharing, as an example."
7,What are the API requirements that apply to the Consent building block?,4,4_GovStack_Specs,"In general, the Consent Building Block shall follow the authentication and authorisation requirements as laid out in the GovStack architecture. For clarity, Consent Building Block's API endpoints are invoked with a client-supplied API key which must defer to the Identification and Verification Building Block in order to verify the role and/or scope of the API key matches the API endpoint to which it is supplied.

4.1 Citizen-Centric","Consent Building Block deals with transparency on data usage in a given context. Thus privacy-by-design of the system's actors is often an excellent guiding principle for interpreting international, national, and organisational policies and governance principles to implement the functional consent framework. A tangible outcome from a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) is a structured approach that can deliver the input for the actual implementation of the Consent Building Block.","This document is intended to provide guidance for building block working groups and developers of products that will be integrated into a GovStack implementation. It also provides guidlines for implementers and system integrators who are deploying solutions that leverage the GovStack approach. It provides guidelines and principles that should be considered by all building blocks and cross-cutting requirements that must be considered for any GovStack project.

This will accelerate the collaborative development of best-of-breed digital public goods, enhancing efficiency and transparency across the world - especially in low-resource settings.

2.1 GovStack and the Building Blocks Approach","To avoid ambiguity, we use the precise term Data Processing Auditor to stress the specificity of tasks to be performed by and for the Consent Building Block; all other actions not within the Consent Building Block's scope are considered as an external prerequisite and as a “black box” activity. With respect to audit, this role is distinguished from the data policy auditor. The Data Processing Auditor relies on an audit universe defined by the control and risk management of the specific project and context (i.e. outside the Consent Building Block). “Who needs to consent to what” is the outcome of a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Analysis), ensuring that the data policies are compliant with the relevant data protection regulations for the project.

The main actions a Data Processing Auditor (or Data Protection Officer, DPO) is expected to perform via Consent Building Block are:

auditing tracking the consents (opt-in/opt-out);"
